### Overview
Stay and Mental Health is a SQL-based project that explores how the length of stay affects the mental health diagnostic scores of international students at a Japanese university. The project uses PostgreSQL to analyze data from a 2018 survey and examines the relationship between stay duration and three key mental health indicators.
### Features
* Count the number of international students for each length of stay.
* Calculate the average depression score (PHQ-9 test).
* Calculate the average social connectedness score (SCS test).
* Calculate the average acculturative stress score (ASISS test).
* Sort results by the length of stay in descending order.
### Technologies Used
* PostgreSQL
* SQL

  
### What I Learned
Through this project, I gained valuable experience in:
* Writing SQL queries for data aggregation and analysis.
* Using GROUP BY to group data based on categories.
* Filtering grouped data with the WHERE and HAVING clauses.
* Rounding numerical results with the ROUND() function.
* Applying COUNT() and AVG() aggregate functions.
  
### Acknowledgment
* Data source from a Japanese international university survey (2018).
